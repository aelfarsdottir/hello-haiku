# hello-haiku
Final Project

A website that lets users determine the thematic focus of an automatically generated haiku poem and presents the poem in an aesthetically pleasing layout with a choice of background photos. Users may also save a history of their haikus if they create an account, and share their haikus via Facebook, Instagram, or email.
